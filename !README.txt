Hey there! As a heads up, this was originally intended for me to use with my Sonic Music pack to give the Organization more unique themes that honestly are deserved. 
However; upon reflection, I never saw this mod ever become a thing outside of KH2FM Double Plus, so I decided to make it happen for everyone to use as they see fit! 
This mod comes stock with Legacy KH Boss Themes, as well as 1 Final Fantasy OST for the FF Ally Run after HB Demyx. However, I made it easy for these tracks to be changed how anyone would see fit!
Please enjoy, and don't hesistate to use this mod for any music pack you may do!
